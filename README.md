# ðŸ“Šâœ¨ Google Play-store Ratings Prediction ðŸŒŸðŸ“±

This project involves predicting the ratings of apps on the Google Play Store using machine learning techniques. It includes data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting app ratings based on various features.

Overview:

In this notebook, we will explore and build a model to predict the ratings of Google Playstore apps based on various features. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to understand the factors influencing app ratings and make accurate predictions. We will follow a systematic approach, starting with data preprocessing, followed by model building and evaluation, and finally applying feature selection techniques to enhance model performance.

# Structure:

# Introduction

Objective: Define the purpose of the notebook and the problem being addressed.
Dataset Overview: Briefly describe the dataset, including the source and features.
Data Loading and Exploration
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset and display basic information.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Check for missing values.
Summarize statistics and visualize feature distributions.
Analyze correlations between features and the target variable (app ratings).

# Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features if necessary.
Feature Engineering: Create or modify features to enhance model performance.

# Initial Model Building

Train/Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
Training: Train the KNN model on the training data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Feature Selection Techniques

Filter Method: Apply a filter technique (e.g., Chi-Square or Mutual Information) to select important features.
Wrapper Method: Use a wrapper technique (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination) with KNN to identify relevant features.
Embedded Method: Implement an embedded technique (e.g., LASSO) for feature selection.

# Model Rebuilding and Evaluation

Feature Selection Application: Apply the selected features to the model.
Model Training: Train the KNN model using the selected features.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model with selected features and compare it with the initial model.

# Results and Discussion

Performance Comparison: Compare the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of models with and without feature selection.
Insights: Discuss how feature selection impacted model performance and any notable findings.

# Conclusion

Summary: Recap the key findings and the effectiveness of feature selection techniques.
Future Work: Suggest potential improvements and next steps for further analysis.
